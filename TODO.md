# TODO - Voice Sentiment Analysis App

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- [x] Analyze requirements
- [ ] Set up project structure with `frontend/` and `backend/` folders
- [ ] Initialize backend (FastAPI or Flask) for handling audio uploads and API calls
- [ ] Initialize frontend (ReactJS) for UI

## Phase 2: Backend Implementation
- [ ] Implement audio upload endpoint (support single/multiple files)
- [ ] Integrate ElevenLabs API for:
  - [ ] Speech-to-Text (STT)
  - [ ] Speaker diarization
- [ ] Process transcription and speaker tags
- [ ] Send processed text to OpenAI ChatGPT API for sentiment/emotion analysis
- [ ] Define JSON response structure:
  ```json
  {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "time": "HH:MM:SS",
    "audio_length": "00:05:23",
    "emotion": "happy/sad/neutral/etc",
    "satisfaction": "high/medium/low"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Return JSON response to frontend

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Create ReactJS app inside `frontend/`
- [ ] Implement file upload UI (single/multiple audio files)
- [ ] Send uploaded files to backend API
- [ ] Display sentiment analysis results in a structured format
- [ ] Show JSON structure in the UI

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test with sample audio files
- [ ] Validate diarization and sentiment accuracy
- [ ] Ensure multiple audio uploads work correctly
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully (invalid file, API failure, etc.)

## Phase 5: Deployment & Finalization
- [ ] Add environment variable support for API keys (ElevenLabs, OpenAI)
- [ ] Update README with setup instructions
- [ ] Final testing and polish
